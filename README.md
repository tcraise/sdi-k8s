# Kubernetes

GSK is beginning the containers and kubernetes journey with the primary goal to improve efficiency of development teams.  The Software Defined Infrastructure (SDI) team is leading the design, deployment and operation of GSK's on-premise kubernetes footprint.  The kubernetes environments will be consumed by all lines of business.

Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts; providing mechanisms for deployment , maintenance, and scaling of applications.
